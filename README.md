# Linear Algebra Coding Problem

This code checks if the given set of tuples "elemts" is a subspace of (Z/2Z)^4 under vector addition and scalar multiplication. It first converts the elements of "elemts" into tuples of 4, then performs vector addition and scalar multiplication on the tuples and checks if the resulting tuples are present in the original set of tuples. If all the resulting tuples are present in the original set of tuples, it prints "True", otherwise it prints "False".
